### :wrench: Architecture and Design

#### Frontend:
- **React.js**: The client side is built with React.js, using component-based architecture to ensure scalability and reusability. The application follows a clean structure to support various features like user authentication, accommodation listing, and bookings.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The app uses Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface with utility-first styling.
  
#### Backend:
- **Node.js & Express**: The server side is built using Node.js and Express.js, handling the logic for user authentication, data validation, and routing.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing user data, bookings, and property listings. Itâ€™s a NoSQL database well-suited for scalable applications like Airdnd.
  
#### Additional Features:
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), allowing for protected routes and personalized user experiences.
- **Image Uploads**: Integrated image upload feature for property listings, allowing hosts to upload images of their properties.
- **Real-time Availability**: Check-in and check-out dates are validated in real-time to prevent double bookings or availability conflicts.
